# Mooncascade web developer demo project

This is how we like to code web applications at Mooncascade. The project is based on ES6, Redux, React and MaterialUI.

If this seems interesting to you, try running the code and resolving some of the open issues. Let us know if you like it, drop us a line at [jobs@mooncascade.com](mailto:jobs@mooncascade.com)

### Installation

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

And to run the project in development mode, you must start the backend service and webpack dev server
```
php backend.php
npm start
```

By default the application will be available at localhost on port 3000, and the backend will be on port 3001
